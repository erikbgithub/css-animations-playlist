## CSS Animation examples

To [do this Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iGYgmEd2dm3zAKzyCGDtM5)
I don't want to recreate all the resources, so I took the original repo and
moved things around. The plan is to follow the tutorials and build `html+css` on
the go.


1. I tried to implement the first real tutorial from
   [video #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYlJR4Le228&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iGYgmEd2dm3zAKzyCGDtM5&index=3)
   with [webflow](https://webflow.io/).

   Here is the published result: https://eriks-css-tuts.webflow.io/

   Sadly it is impossible to copy&paste the generated code from a free account.
   Also, I did not really like creating HTML+CSS that way. My impression is that
   HTML+CSS was created not with UI tools in mind, and this tool does not do
   anything beyond wrapping HTML+CSS with UI clicks. E.g., modifying a
   basically invisible list of divs in a drag&drop UI feels unintuitive for me.

   But I also found that codepen.io allows me to write code much quicker than
   VIM+Firefox. And it allows code export. So, I will try that one for the next
   video.

2. The second tutorial with codepen worked much better. Find the code in the
   subdirectory `/tut2` and in this
   [codepen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/ExKZRe).
