## CSS Animation examples

To [do this Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iGYgmEd2dm3zAKzyCGDtM5)
I don't want to recreate all the resources, so I took the original repo and
moved things around. The plan is to follow the tutorials and build `html+css` on
the go.


1. I tried to implement the first real tutorial from
   [video #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYlJR4Le228&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iGYgmEd2dm3zAKzyCGDtM5&index=3)
   with [webflow](https://webflow.io/).

   Here is the published result: https://eriks-css-tuts.webflow.io/

   Sadly it is impossible to copy&paste the generated code from a free account.
   Also, I did not really like creating HTML+CSS that way. My impression is that
   HTML+CSS was created not with UI tools in mind, and this tool does not do
   anything beyond wrapping HTML+CSS with UI clicks. E.g., modifying a
   basically invisible list of divs in a drag&drop UI feels unintuitive for me.

   But I also found that codepen.io allows me to write code much quicker than
   VIM+Firefox. And it allows code export. So, I will try that one for the next
   video.

2. The second tutorial with codepen worked much better. Find the code in the
   subdirectory `/tut2` and in this
   [codepen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/ExKZRe).

3. After the initial hickup with the dev environment the progress is smooth,
   so just follow the `/tutX` structure to go the relative next training and
   look at the effects in the
   [codepen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/ExKZRe).

4. ...

9. After the car race game the quality drops a little with a lot of code that is
   just expected to work out of the blue in any circumstances and just a small
   explanation. So I did one of those as well in codepen, but am struggling to
   behave the same way in the small codepen window as it does in the video.

Therefore I've decided to stop at that point.
